-- Installs the language servers and linters this config expects, then exits.
--
-- Run headlessly from the install scripts:
--   nvim --headless -c "luafile ~/.config/nvim/bootstrap-mason.lua"
--
-- Note: -c luafile, not -l. `nvim -l` does not load the user config, so lazy.nvim
-- would not exist and the Lazy! command would fail.
--
-- Why this exists: mason-lspconfig installs a server the first time you open a
-- matching filetype. That works, but it means the first real session on a new
-- machine has no LSP while things download in the background. Doing it during
-- install instead means the editor is complete the first time you open it.
--
-- The list is explicit rather than derived. Deriving it from the enabled extras
-- means a silent no-op the moment LazyVim renames something, and a silent no-op
-- here looks exactly like a working install until you press `gd` and nothing
-- happens.
--
-- Which of them can actually install here depends on the machine: mason pulls
-- from several ecosystems and each needs its own toolchain. That is read from
-- each package's registry entry rather than hardcoded, so it stays correct if a
-- package changes how it ships. At time of writing:
--   github -> standalone binary, no runtime (ruff, marksman, taplo,
--             lua-language-server, shellcheck, hadolint)
--   pypi   -> needs python3                 (basedpyright)
--   npm    -> needs node                    (yaml, json, docker, bash, markdown)
--
-- Per-package matters. An earlier version gated the whole run behind `node`,
-- which on a box without node installed zero servers where seven would have been
-- fine. basedpyright especially: it is pypi, and python3 is a safe bet on a GPU
-- box in a way node is not.
